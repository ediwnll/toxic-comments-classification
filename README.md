## Project Overview

The **Misinformation Detection Platform** is a machine learning project designed to identify and classify various forms of toxic content within text comments. Leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the platform effectively detects categories such as toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity hate in user-generated content.

This project addresses the challenges of multi-label classification in the presence of highly imbalanced datasets, ensuring that minority classes are accurately identified without compromising overall model performance.

## Features

- **Multi-Label Classification:** Simultaneously detects multiple categories of toxic content.
- **Imbalanced Data Handling:** Implements class weighting and logarithmic scaling to manage class imbalance.
- **Advanced Model Architecture:** Utilizes BERT-based models from Hugging Face for robust text understanding.
- **Custom Loss Function:** Employs a weighted Binary Cross-Entropy loss to prioritize minority classes.
- **Training Stability Enhancements:** Incorporates gradient clipping, learning rate scheduling, and mixed precision training to ensure stable and efficient training.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Uses metrics like F1-score, precision, recall, and confusion matrices to assess model performance.
- **Visualization Tools:** Integrates TensorBoard for real-time monitoring of training progress.
- **Deployment Ready:** Prepares the model for real-time inference in production environments.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Scikit-learn
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy, Regex
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorBoard
- **Experiment Tracking:** Weights & Biases (W&B)
- **Version Control:** GitHub
- **Deployment:** [Specify if deployed, e.g., AWS, Heroku, etc.]

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset comprising user-generated comments, each annotated with multiple labels indicating different forms of toxicity. The primary labels include:

- **Toxic**
- **Severe Toxic**
- **Obscene**
- **Threat**
- **Insult**
- **Identity Hate**

### Dataset Source

- [Specify the source, e.g., Kaggle Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)

### Data Description

- **Number of Samples:** 150,000+
- **Features:** 
  - `comment_text`: The text content of the user comment.
- **Labels:** Binary indicators for each toxicity category.

### Data Preprocessing

- **Cleaning:** Removed HTML tags, URLs, special characters, and extra spaces using regular expressions.
- **Tokenization:** Employed BERT tokenizer to convert text into input IDs and attention masks.
- **Stratified Splitting:** Used Multi-Label Stratified Shuffle Split to ensure balanced representation of all labels in training and validation sets.

## Installation
